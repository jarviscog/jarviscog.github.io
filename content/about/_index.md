**My favorite books to recommend:**
- Salt Fat Acid Heat -- Samin Nosrat
    - For people that think in "systems", it's a great book to understand the building blocks of cooking
- Godel, Escher, Bach -- Douglas Hofstadter
    - Book that ties mathematics, art, and music together
- The Righteous Mind -- Jonathan Haidt
- 跟动物交换身体 - 川崎悟司
    - Even if you can't read Chinese, it's a fun book with great illustrations
