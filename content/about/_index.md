Software Engineer enthusiastic about Languages and Theology


Currently completing my last semester at Western University, taking two courses: [Electronic Circuits](https://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/Courses.cfm?CourseAcadCalendarID=MAIN_021310_1&SelectedCalendar=Live&ArchiveID=) and [Systematic Theology](https://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/Courses.cfm?CourseAcadCalendarID=HURON_019363_1&SelectedCalendar=Live&ArchiveID=)

After that...not too sure yet. Starting full-time work, and working in Backend, Low-level/embedded systems, and security.
